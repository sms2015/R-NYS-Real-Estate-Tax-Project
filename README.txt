New York Property Taxes vs Inflation and Income, 2011 vs 2004

PROJECT SCOPE
This project analyzes property tax rate changes in New York State counties and how these
rates compare to the inflation rate (as measured by the CPI - Consumer Price Index) and 
income level (as measured by AGI - Adjusted Gross Income) changes between 2004 and 2011. 
This purpose of this comparison is to evaluate how much the property tax burden has 
changed relative to inflation and income for New York State counties. 

R Studio was used for this analysis.  
Included in this directory is the code which appears in the .rmd file in this directory,
the pdf report created from this R Markdown file, and the pdf presentation also created 
using R Markdown.
